Regression analysis for predicting sampled-level cell type proportion from gene expression. 
The current method is a low rank, ridge regularized approach which is inspired from [1].

The [Analysis](Analysis) folder contains scripts and notebooks show important results:
a. Stem cells' gene expression profile can predict cell type proportion
b. Terminal cells' gene expression profile can improve the prediction of their corresponding proportion.
